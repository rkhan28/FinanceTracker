# üí∏ AI-Powered Finance Tracker  
*A smarter way to understand your money*

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**AI-Powered Finance Tracker** is a simple, intelligent personal finance app designed to help users:

- ‚úÖ Monitor daily and monthly expenses
- üí° Get smart insights on spending habits
- ü§ñ Ask AI questions about confusing bills or unexpected charges

This is my **first major personal project** and a big step in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I‚Äôm building it as a hands-on learning experience, with a goal of blending useful AI tools with everyday needs.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìä Visual dashboard for expense tracking
- üîç Insights into spending patterns and categories
- üí¨ Natural language queries like:  
  ‚ÄúWhat did I spend on food last month?‚Äù or  
  ‚ÄúWhy was my utility bill so high?‚Äù
- üîê Focus on privacy and simplicity

## üß† How It Works

The app combines two main components:

- **Finance Tracking Engine** ‚Äì Logs and categorizes user expenses, helping build a historical view of spending.
- **AI Assistant** ‚Äì Processes your data and answers natural-language questions using AI models, so you don‚Äôt have to crunch numbers yourself.

- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Supporting logic and utilities  
- **CSS** ‚Äì Styling for layout and components
